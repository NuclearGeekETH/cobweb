Clone the repository

For the Flask Server to run the website:

Run server.py and install missing dependencies. You will need a .env file in root with your web3.storage or pinata keys. Once running open a web browser and navigate to localhost:3000. 

For the Twitter Bot:

Run bot.py and install missing dependencies. Add your keys for twitter and web3.storage or pinata to the .env file in root.

Troubleshooting:

You will need your version of chromedriver.exe for your version of chrome installed on your system. Flask app.run() will need to be modified for your environment. Make sure you add a .env file in root with your keys

Do Next:

 - Add a gallery of pins that are public and personal
